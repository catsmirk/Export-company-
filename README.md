# Export-company
This repository contains the code for implementing a simple data warehouse using a PostgreSQL server.
After creating the data warehouse, the warehouse is loaded onto Metabase to create some visualization of the data.
All the data here in this repository is a simplified version used as simulation of an actual export company data.
